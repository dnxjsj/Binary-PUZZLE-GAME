# Binary-PUZZLE-GAME

"This is an octal-binary puzzle modeled after scrambled cube configurations. By mapping the original state of a scrambled cube into hex color codes and applying specialized encryption rules, the data has been fragmented into a stream exceeding 300KB. Your mission is to decrypt the code and restore the original color alignment by navigating the slide puzzle. Good luck."
