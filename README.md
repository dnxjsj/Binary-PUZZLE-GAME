# Binary-PUZZLE-GAME

"This puzzle is inspired by scrambled Rubik's Cube configurations. By mapping the cube's state to hex color codes and applying a multi-layered encryption process, the data has been transformed into an octal stream exceeding 300KB. Your mission is to decrypt the raw data and restore the original matrix by solving the integrated slide puzzle. Good luck."

"This isn't just a slide puzzle. It’s a multi-layered cryptographic challenge that encodes a Rubik’s Cube state into a 300KB octal data stream. Built by a high school sophomore, this project tests your ability to reverse-engineer data as much as your spatial logic."

"Just a high schooler exploring the limits of data encoding. I turned a Rubik's Cube into a 300KB octal stream. Looking for someone who can actually solve this."

(A puzzle that even ChatGPT can't solve, can you?)
